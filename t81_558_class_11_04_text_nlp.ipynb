    "### Word-Level Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different approaches to teaching a neural network to output free-form text.  The most basic question is if you wish the neural network to learn at the word or character level.  In many ways, learning at the character level is the more interesting of the two.  The LSTM is learning construct its own words without even being shown what a word is.  We will begin with character-level text generation.  In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level.  The automatic captioning that will be implemented in the next module is at the word level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the needed Python packages and defining the sequence length, named **maxlen**.  Time-series neural networks always accept their input as a fixed length array.  Not all of the sequence might be used, it is common to fill extra elements with zeros.  The text will be divided into sequences of this length and the neural network will be trained to predict what comes after this sequence."
