    "\n",

    "The primary purpose for a convolutional layer is to detect features such as edges, lines, blobs of color, and other visual elements. The filters can detect these features. The more filters that we give to a convolutional layer, the more features it can detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter is a square-shaped object that scans over the image. A grid can represent the individual pixels of a grid. You can think of the convolutional layer as a smaller grid that sweeps left to right over each row of the image. There is also a hyper parameter that specifies both the width and height of the square-shaped filter. Figure 10.1 shows this configuration in which you see the six convolutional filters sweeping over the image grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer has weights between it and the previous layer or image grid. Each pixel on each convolutional layer is a weight. Therefore, the number of weights between a convolutional layer and its predecessor layer or image field is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[FilterSize] * [FilterSize] * [# of Filters]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the filter size were 5 (5x4) for 10 filters, there would be 250 weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand how the convolutional filters sweep across the previous layer’s output or image grid. Figure 10.2 illustrates the sweep:\n",
    "\n",
    "![CNN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_8_cnn_grid.png \"CNN\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The above figure shows a convolutional filter with a size of 4 and a padding size of 1. The padding size is responsible for the boarder of zeros in the area that the filter sweeps. Even though the image is actually 8x7, the extra padding provides a virtual image size of 9x8 for the filter to sweep across. The stride specifies the number of positions at which the convolutional filters will stop. The convolutional filters move to the right, advancing by the number of cells specified in the stride. Once the far right is reached, the convolutional filter moves back to the far left, then it moves down by the stride amount and\n",
    "continues to the right again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some constraints exist in relation to the size of the stride. Obviously, the stride cannot be 0. The convolutional filter would never move if the stride were set to 0. Furthermore, neither the stride, nor the convolutional filter size can be larger than the previous grid. There are additional constraints on the stride (s), padding (p) and the filter width (f) for an image of width (w). Specifically, the convolutional filter must be able to start at the far left or top boarder, move a certain number of strides, and land on the far right or bottom boarder. The following equation shows the number of steps a convolutional operator\n",
    "must take to cross the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ steps = \\frac{w - f + 2p}{s+1} $\n",

    "## Max Pooling Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Max-pool layers downsample a 3D box to a new one with smaller dimensions. Typically, you can always place a max-pool layer immediately following convolutional layer. The LENET shows the max-pool layer immediately after layers C1 and C3. These max-pool layers progressively decrease the size of the dimensions of the 3D boxes passing through them. This technique can avoid overfitting (Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton, 2012).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Spatial Extent (f )\n",
    "* Stride (s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike convolutional layers, max-pool layers do not use padding. Additionally, max-pool layers have no weights, so training does not affect them. These layers simply downsample their 3D box input. The 3D box output by a max-pool layer will have a width equal to this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - f}{s + 1} $\n",

    "The height of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is calculated similarly with this equation:\n",

    "$ h_2 = \\frac{h_1 - f}{s + 1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the 3D box produced by the max-pool layer is equal to the depth the 3D box received as input. The most common setting for the hyper-parameters of a max-pool layer are f =2 and s=2. The spatial extent (f) specifies that boxes of 2x2 will be scaled down to single pixels. Of these four pixels, the pixel with the maximum value will represent the 2x2 pixel in the new grid. Because squares of size 4 are replaced with size 1, 75% of the pixel information is lost. The following figure shows this transformation as a 6x6 grid becomes a 3x3:\n",
