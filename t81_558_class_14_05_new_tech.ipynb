    "[Neural Structured Learning (NSL)](https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning) provides additional training information to the neural network. [[Cite:bui2018neural]](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46568.pdf) This training information is in the form of a graph that relates individual training cases (rows in your training set) among each other. This allows the neural network to be trained to greater accuracy with a smaller number of labeled data.  When the neural network is ultimately used for scoring and prediction, once training completes, the graph data is no longer provided.\n",
