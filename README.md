# T81 558:Applications of Deep Neural Networks

Spring 2018, Mondays, Online and in class room: Cupples II / L001

# Course Description

Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination 
of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible 
to create neural networks of much greater complexity. Deep learning allows a neural network to 
learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain. This 
course will introduce the student to computer vision with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), 
time series analysis with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), classic neural network structures and 
application to computer security. High Performance Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how 
deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus 
is primarily upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction mathematical 
foundations. Students will use the Python programming language to implement deep learning using 
Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary to know Python prior to this course; however, 
familiarity of at least one programming language is assumed. This course will be delivered in a 
hybrid format that includes both classroom and online instruction.

# Objectives

1. Explain how neural networks (deep and otherwise) compare to other machine learning models. 
2. Determine when a deep neural network would be a good choice for a particular problem.
3. Demonstrate your understanding of the material through a final project uploaded to GitHub.
