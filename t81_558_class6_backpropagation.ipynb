    "# Classic Backpropagation\n",
    "Backpropagation is the primary means by which a neural network's weights are determined during training. Backpropagation works by calculating a weight change amount ($v_t$) for every weight($\\theta$, theata) in the neural network.  This value is subtracted from every weight by the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\theta_t = \\theta_{t-1} - v_t $\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for every iteration($t$).  How the weight change is calculated depends on the training algorithm.  Classic backpropagation simply calculates a gradient ($\\nabla$, nabla) for every weight in the neural network with respect to the error function ($J$) of the neural network.  The gradient is scaled by a learning rate ($\\eta$, eta).\n",
    "\n",
    "$ v_t = \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta_{t-1}} J(\\theta_{t-1}) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate is an important concept for backpropagation training.  Setting the learning rate can be complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Too low of a learning rate will usually converge to a good solution; however, the process will be very slow.\n",
    "* Too high of a learning rate will either fail outright, or converge to a higher error than a better learning rate.\n",

    "* **Adagrad** - Allows an automatically decaying per-weight learning rate and momentum concept.\n",
    "* **Adadelta** - Extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\n",
    "* **Non-Gradient Methods** - Non-gradient methods can *sometimes* be useful, though rarely outperform gradient-based backpropagation methods.

Kingma and Ba (2014) introduced the Adam update rule that derives its name from the adaptive moment estimates that it uses.
