    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique that reduces overfitting, which occurs when neural networks attempt to memorize training data, rather than learn from it.  Humans are capable of overfitting as well.  Before we examine the ways that a machine accidentally overfits, we will first explore how humans can suffer from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human programmers often take certification exams to show their competence in a given programming language.  To help prepare for these exams, the test makers often make practice exams available.  Consider a programmer who enters a loop of taking the practice exam, studying more, and then taking the practice exam again.  At some point, the programmer has memorized much of the practice exam, rather than learning the techniques necessary to figure out the individual questions.  The programmer has now overfit to the practice exam.  When this programmer takes the real exam, his actual score will likely be lower than what he earned on the practice exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can overfit as well.  Although a neural network received a high score on its training data, this result does not mean that the same neural network will score high on data that was not inside the training set.  Regularization is one of the techniques that can prevent overfitting. A number of different regularization techniques exist.  Most work by analyzing and potentially modifying the weights of a neural network as it trains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### L1 and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques that can reduce the effects of overfitting (Ng, 2004).  Both of these algorithms can either work with an objective function or as a part of the backpropagation algorithm.  In both cases the regularization algorithm is attached to the training algorithm by adding an additional objective.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these algorithms work by adding a weight penalty to the neural network training.  This penalty encourages the neural network to keep the weights to small values.  Both L1 and L2 calculate this penalty differently.  For gradient-descent-based algorithms, such as backpropagation, you can add this penalty calculation to the calculated gradients.  For objective-function-based training, such as simulated annealing, the penalty is negatively combined with the objective score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at linear regression to see how L1 and L2 regularization work.  The following code sets up the auto-mpg data for this purpose."

Regression is the simpler case where you can simply break up the data set into K folds with little regard for where each item lands.  For regression it is best that the data items fall into the folds as randomly as possible.  It is also important to remember that not every fold will necessarily have exactly the same number of data items.  It is not always possible for the data set to be evenly divided into K folds.  For regression cross-validation we will use the Scikit-Learn class **KFold**.\n",

    "Cross validation for classification could also use the **KFold** object; however, this technique would not ensure that the class balance remains the same in each fold as it was in the original.  It is very important that the balance of classes that a model was trained on remains the same (or similar) to the training set.  A drift in this distribution is one of the most important things to monitor after a trained model has been placed into actual use.  Because of this, we want to make sure that the cross-validation itself does not introduce an unintended shift. This is referred to as stratified sampling and is accomplished by using the Scikit-Learn object **StratifiedKFold** in place of **KFold** whenever you are using classification.  In summary, the following two objects in Scikit-Learn should be used:\n",

    "\n",
    "Quite a few hyperparameters have been introduced so far.  Tweaking each of these values can have an effect on the score obtained by your neural networks.  Some of the hyperparameters seen so far include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of layers in the neural network\n",
    "* How many neurons in each layer\n",
    "* What activation functions to use on each layer\n",
    "* Dropout percent on each layer\n",
    "* L1 and L2 values on each layer\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out each of these hyperparameters you will need to run train neural networks with multiple settings for each hyperparameter.  However, you may have noticed that neural networks often produce somewhat different results when trained multiple times.  This is because the neural networks start with random weights.  Because of this it is necessary to fit and evaluate a neural network times to ensure that one set of hyperparameters are actually better than another.  Bootstrapping can be an effective means of benchmarking (comparing) two sets of hyperparameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is similar to cross-validation.  Both go through a number of cycles/folds providing validation and training sets.  However, bootstrapping can have an unlimited number of cycles.  Bootstrapping chooses a new train and validation split each cycle, with replacement.  The fact that each cycle is chosen with replacement means that, unlike cross validation, there will often be repeated rows selected between cycles.  If you run the bootstrap for enough cycles, there will be duplicate cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will use bootstrapping for hyperparameter benchmarking.  We will train a neural network for a specified number of splits (denoted by the SPLITS constant).  For these examples we use 100.  We will compare the average score at the end of the 100.  By the end of the cycles the mean score will have converged somewhat.  This ending score will be a much better basis of comparison than a single cross-validation.  Additionally, the average number of epochs will be tracked to give an idea of a possible optimal value.  Because the early stopping validation set is also used to evaluate the the neural network as well, it might be slightly inflated.  This is because we are both stopping and evaluating on the same sample.  However, we are using the scores only as relative measures to determine the superiority of one set of hyperparameters to another, so this slight inflation should not present too much of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are benchmarking, we will display the amount of time taken for each cycle.  The following function can be used to nicely format a time span."
