    "\n",
    "Neural networks were one of the first machine learning models.  Their popularity has fallen twice and is now on its third rise.  Deep learning implies the use of neural networks.  The \"deep\" in deep learning refers to a neural network with many hidden layers.  Because neural networks have been around for so long, they have quite a bit of baggage.  Many different training algorithms, activation/transfer functions, and structures have been added over the years.  This course is only concerned with the latest, most current state of the art techniques for deep neural networks.  I am not going to spend any time discussing the history of neural networks.  If you would like to learn about some of the more classic structures of neural networks, there are several chapters dedicated to this in your course book.  For the latest technology, I wrote an article for the Society of Actuaries on deep learning as the [third generation of neural networks](https://www.soa.org/Library/Newsletters/Predictive-Analytics-and-Futurism/2015/december/paf-iss12.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks accept input and produce output.  The input to a neural network is called the feature vector.  The size of this vector is always a fixed length.  Changing the size of the feature vector means recreating the entire neural network.  Though the feature vector is called a \"vector,\" this is not always the case.  A vector implies a 1D array.  Historically the input to a neural network was always 1D.  However, with modern neural networks you might see inputs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1D Vector** - Classic input to a neural network, similar to rows in a spreadsheet.  Common in predictive modeling.\n",
    "* **2D Matrix** - Grayscale image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **3D Matrix** - Color image input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "* **nD Matrix** - Higher order input to a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to CNN's, the image input was sent to a neural network simply by squashing the image matrix into a long array by placing the image's rows side-by-side.  CNNs are different, as the nD matrix literally passes through the neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially this course will focus upon 1D input to neural networks.  However, later sessions will focus more heavily upon higher dimension input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions** The term dimension can be confusing in neural networks.  In the sense of a 1D input vector, dimension refers to how many elements are in that 1D array.  For example, a neural network with 10 input neurons has 10 dimensions.  However, now that we have CNN's, the input has dimensions too.  The input to the neural network will *usually* have 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.  4 or more dimensions is unusual.  You might have a 2D input to a neural network that has 64x64 pixels.  This would result in 4,096 input neurons.  This network is either 2D or 4,096D, depending on which set of dimensions you are talking about!"

This attempts to stop at a near optimal training point.  This method will only give accurate \"out of sample\" predictions for the validation set, this is usually 20% or so of the data.

    "\n",
    "In the previous section we used early stopping so that the training would halt once the validation set no longer saw score improvements for a number of epoch.  This number of epochs that early stopping will tolerate no improvement is called *patience*.  If the patience value is large, the neural network's error may continue to worsen while early stopping is patiently waiting.  At some point earlier in the training the optimal set of weights was obtained for the neural network.  However, at the end of training we will have the weights for the neural network that finally exhausted the patience of early stopping.  The weights of this neural network might not be bad, but it would be better to have the most optimal weights during the entire training operation.  \n",

Once training is done, we just reload this file and we have the optimal training weights that were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is slight overkill for many of the examples for this class.  It can also introduce an occasional issue (as described in the next section).  Because of this, most of the examples in this course will not use this code to obtain the absolute best weights.  However, for the larger, more complex datasets in this course, we will save the absolute best weights as demonstrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Keras Issue on Small Networks and Early Stopping\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you can just run rerun the code and it goes away.  This is an unfortunate result of saving a file each time the validation score improves (as described in the previous section).  If the errors improve two rapidly, you might try to save the file twice and get an error from these two saves overlapping.  For larger neural networks this will not be a problem because each training step will take longer, allowing for plenty of time for the previous save to complete.  Because of this potential issue, this code is not used with every neural network in this course. "

It is not hard to simply hand-code the neurons to provide an [XOR function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or); however, for simplicity, we will allow Keras to train this network for us.  We will just use 100K epochs on the ADAM optimizer.  This is massive overkill, but it gets the result, and our focus here is not on tuning.  The neural network is small.  Two inputs, two hidden neurons, and a single output."
